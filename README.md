# parrot-count
Project Description:

This project, inspired by the cartoon "38 Parrots," lets you measure things using the sizes of cartoon characters. The user enters the name of an item and its length in meters, and the program gives the equivalent in parrots, boas, and other characters. 
For example:

- The house is equal to 2133 parrots.
- The house is equal to 43 boas.

The project offers a fun way to understand sizes through cartoon characters.
